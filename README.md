# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
In my SQL project, I conducted an exploratory analysis of Covid-19 deaths and vaccination data from March 2020 to June 2021 using MS-SQL Server. The raw dataset, sourced from Our World in Data, was imported into a SQL Database on my local machine. The analysis involved using various SQL skills, including Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.

## Skills Utilized:
### 1) Joins
### 2) Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
### 3) Temporary Tables
### 4) Window Functions
### 5) Aggregate Functions
### 6) Creating Views
### 7) Converting Data Types

## Data Source:
### COVID-19 Deaths Dataset ( https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths )

## Tools:
### MS-SQL Server
